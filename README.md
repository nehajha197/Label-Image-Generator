Overview

This project is an automated image labeling system that leverages AWS Rekognition to analyze images and generate descriptive labels.
When an image is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, an AWS Lambda function is triggered to process the image and extract labels, 
which are then stored in a JSON file for future retrieval.
